# DnD-Tavern

This is an app for 4th Edition D&D.  It generates random adventurers that you would find in a tavern.  The adventurers have special rules that are meant to simly the character.  These adventuers are meant to aid in adventures not substitute missing characters from the group.  This is a project that I have been tinkering with for a couple of weeks and is still pretty rough.
